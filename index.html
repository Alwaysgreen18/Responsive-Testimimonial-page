                <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
                if not more so, in the company I joined. 
                I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                " I was an EMT for many years before 
                I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition 
                and have heard some people who have had 
                an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it 
                incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was 
                the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the 
                coursee, I've succesfully switched careers, working 
                as a software engineer at a VR startup."</span></p>

                <p>Awesome teaching supportm from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting 
                guidance from them and learning fromtheir experiences was easy. 
                <span class="sub-text">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress 
                which I find really refreshing. The program give me confidence neccessary to be 
                able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. 
                The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an

                <p class="text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! 
                <span class="sub-text-1">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written 
                a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help 
                me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on 
                and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in 
                particular, was outstanding. It took my lerning to the next level in a way 
                that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I'[ve often referred to it during  
                interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me 
                land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
